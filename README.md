<!--## Intro 
## Demo

As a demonstration, I created a pokemon store app on top of the boilerplate and that interacting with this pokemons api: 
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2

<!--## Project structure 


## Config and dev tools 
## Linting and formatting 

the eslint config is inheriting airbnb rules
tip: about eslint extension in vscode 


<!-- ## Responsiveness 

The app is designated to run on multiple devices and the window breakpoints used are: 

* xxs -> 340px
* xs -> 380px
* sm -> 450px
* md -> 800px 
* xl -> 1100px 
* lg -> 1300px 

the breakpoints declaration can be found in src/styles/theme.scss


## Development 

Locally exploring the project can be done once this sequence of commands are executed:
* `git clone` 
*  `yarn install` 
*  `yarn start`
